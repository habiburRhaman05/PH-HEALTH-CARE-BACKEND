**“Complete Hospital Management System”**

## 📌 Project Overview

**PH-HealthCare** is a **full-stack hospital management system** designed to digitize and automate real-world hospital operations.

The system connects **Patients, Doctors, Admins, and Super Admins** in a secure, scalable, and role-based platform.
Patients can book appointments, doctors can manage schedules and prescriptions, admins can control hospital operations, and super admins manage the entire system.

> ⚠️ This is **NOT a demo project**.
> This backend is designed to support **real hospital workflows**.
